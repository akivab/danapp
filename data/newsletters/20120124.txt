There are essentially two ways to live luxuriously in Greenwich Village: the luxury high-rise and the townhouse.  The choice is ultimately a very personal one.

Some dream of the acknowledgment of success that comes with walking into the elevator and pressing "PH."  Of course, it won't be long until all of your neighbors recognize that you are a very wealthy individual.  This is often the preferred route for bankers and entrepreneurs--people who are not constantly in the public eye.  It adds to their notoriety and makes them feel empowered.  A doorman opens the door for you, takes your packages and greets you politely with respect.  In those morning and evening elevator rides, everyone knows you are--literally and figuratively--"at the top."  It's the ultimate status symbol.

In contrast, the townhouse offers a very different kind of luxury.  On a charming village block filled with unassuming townhouses and low-rise rental buildings you can find some of the most famous celebrities and influential people.  Often these are the same people you'll find all over the media--they are not seeking attention; they crave privacy.  The ideal residence for these New Yorkers is the 19th century brick townhouse, transformed from basic housing to a modern palace.  Equipped with all the technology of the 21st century, these brownstones offer the finest in architecture and convenience.  Typical interiors will feature exposed brick throughout, high ceilings, and arched entrances.  While everyone else on the block is walking up to their 500 square foot two bedroom apartment, these privileged few retire to their 5,000 square foot secret mansions decked out with indoor pools, Jacuzzis, theaters and more.  Just invest in a floppy hat, and the neighbors are oblivious.

A few months ago I wrote about rooftop pools in several Village high-rises.  In a few unique townhouses downtown you can find private rooftop and indoor pools.  Want luxury you don't have to share?

This pool was featured on HGTV's "Selling New York."  Originally a 19th century townhouse, the current owners transformed the entire living room into a massive pool.  Swim a few laps in the morning and enjoy a warm pool on those cold winter nights.  I guarantee you will make some friends with this house.  On the market for a cool $11 million.
