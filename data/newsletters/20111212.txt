1. The Villages: An Overview

Quickly becoming the favorite places in NYC to live, the East Village and West Village have seen significant changes over the past decade. No longer the exclusive domain of artists and hipsters, the villages have something to offer for everyone from actuaries to bankers to celebrities to… you get the point.  The West Village, in particular, has experienced significant growth in areas such as park development, including recreation and running lanes along the Hudson River spanning from Battery Park all the way up to the George Washington Bridge.  This includes a skate park and tennis courts (see http://www.hudsonriverpark.org/index.asp).  The High Line has been under development and now features breathtaking river views, coffee and crepe stands and many areas for public enjoyment.
 
The relative growth of the West Village has been spurred by public transportation, which is much more accessible on the west side of Manhattan than the east side. Partly as a result of accessibility issues, the East Village is between 15-25% cheaper to live in than the West Village. Of course, there are significant fluctuations from one block to another.  For example, a walk-up at 31-33 Bedford Street between Carmine and Downing has two bedrooms renting for $2,900-$3,200/month, while a similar apartment near Thompson Square Park in the East Village might rent for $2,400-$2,600/month. That's quite a difference!  Compare 31-33 Bedford Street in the West Village--$2,900/mo (http://www.citi-habitats.com/viewlisting.php?adID=243845) to 506 East 13th Street in the East Village--$2,500/mo  (http://www.citi-habitats.com/viewlisting.php?adID=485700).

2. Who Needs Uptown?

It wouldn't be winter in New York without ice skating—right?  But why trek to Rockefeller Center when the Standard Hotel, located on Washington Street at West 13th Street, has a skating rink open to the wee hours of the night!  Spanning almost two full blocks, this hotel boasts a high end beer garden, an ice skating rink, two high-end lounges on the top floor, a hot tub on the rooftop and a crepe stand.  You can find posh New Yorkers sipping on margaritas on the roof during the nice spring and summer months. This has become a major local attraction. 

Superior Ink - 400 West 12th Street

Steps from the West Side highway--on a beautiful cobblestone street--is this new condo development just minutes from the Standard Hotel, the Hudson River and the High Line.  This building features stunning views, a cinema, and in-house day care.  Check out some photos of a recently rented two bed/two bath, 1441 square feet renting for $13,000/month and recently selling for $3.75 million or a breathtaking $2,600/square foot!

3. How About the East Village?
The East Village and the West Village have much in common. Both have rivers on the extreme bounds (East and Hudson Rivers), highways (Westside highway and FDR), and many popular bars, restaurants and lounges.  But the East Village is currently a much cheaper option than the West Village with less new-construction, less accessibility to public transportation and fewer public attractions. This is all going to change.  Today, prices drop as you get into "Alphabet City" near the East River.  This has much to do with the lack of development along the East River, older housing projects, lack of transportation and a history of crime. With the development of Thompson Square Park and other exciting projects, the East Village is poised to catch up with its tonier neighbor to the west. 

Standard Hotel in East Village?

Some evidence of growth can be seen in the new Standard Hotel—slated to open in 2013—right in the heart of the East Village. They will be taking over what formerly was the Cooper Square Hotel. This will surely rejuvenate the neighborhood.

4. Public Transportation Coming to the East Village!

Often referred to as "the line that time forgot", the Second Avenue subway line is now underway. The estimated completion date is 2016—conservatively, 2018.  Between now and then, developers will likely be trying to snatch up property before the subway is complete.  With easy access to Grand Central Station, the Financial District, Midtown and the Upper East Side, the East Village will now not only be hip, but  hip and convenient.

See this link for more details: http://www.mta.info/capconstr/sas/

Buildings east of Second Avenue could benefit from the increase in land values that would accompany increased accessibility to transportation, especially near Houston-8th Street where the nearest train for many is currently the L train all the way on 14th and First.
 
209 East Second Street

Located on Second Street at Avenue B, this is a new construction that opened in the beginning of 2007. Featuring full floor lofts and a keyed elevator, these units sold for just a bit under $1,000/ square foot. Comparable West Village units sell for between $2,000 and $2,800/square foot.

Check out this 1,468 square foot two bed/two bath that sold for $1.45 million, or $987/square foot and is renting for $6,500 (half the rental price and almost a third of the sale price of the Superior Ink above!):

5. Development and New Construction Along the East River
http://gallery.mailchimp.com/f832646624bdbf8d1d0cd3146/files/eastriver.1.jpg

Plans are already in motion for a $165 million overhaul of the East River planned for completion sometime between 2013 and 2015.  Although the project is in beginning stages, the East River should ultimately be quite similar to the Hudson River in terms of riverside amenities.  There will be a closed off area for cyclists and pedestrians, dog parks, public seating with sweeping views of the river, seaport and Long Island City, beautifully maintained parks and more. This will be a major facelift to the East Side of Manhattan--especially the East Village--allowing runners, tourists and locals to hang out and relax.

New Construction at 316 East 3rd Street (between Avenues C and D)

As a result of new transportation and the development alongside the East River, a few things will happen. First off, the area closest to the river--Alphabet City—should become much more desirable. As demand grows, one would expect developers to buy out what are currently housing projects and build new construction.  This trend has already begun: On 3rd Street at Avenue D a row of houses was just bought by renowned architect Karl Fischer and is being transformed into luxury rental housing. Expect to see more of this type of activity in the area!

6. Conclusion

The West Village today is one of the priciest neighborhoods in Manhattan while the East Village is still relatively affordable.  But the trend points to a considerable gain in East Village property values as development projects complete and new construction comes in.  Expect the East Village to start looking—and costing—much like its counterpart to the west.  As an investor or buyer looking for value, the East Village looks strategically positioned right now.  As you go farther east towards Avenue D, expect to see growth and profit opportunities increase.
