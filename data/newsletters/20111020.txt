Rental Market- a snapshot:
The past 6 months in downtown rentals has been absolutely crazy. I think everyone can benefit from learning just a bit about some of the things that happen when trying to find a place to live in Manhattan. I've really dealt with almost every situation imaginable, and have had to solve all types of crazy problems. There are two main aspects of renting in NYC that are commonly misunderstood.

Pre-paying rent and/or giving extra security deposit.  

It is quite common for someone to assume that if they're willing to pay the years rent upfront, or give substantial security deposit, that they can either bypass the crazy typical paperwork requirements or negotiate on price. In downtown NYC this is NOT the case.  In fact, MOST landlords prefer only taking first months rent and 1-2 months security and have a tenant who is employed, low-key, good credit, single, and over 30.  An individual who owns a rental building in NYC has a lot of risk, responsibility and obligation.  Tenants living in NYC are more protected than almost anywhere in the world. I have dealt personally with landlords who have told me they've been trying to evict a tenant in one of their buildings for over a year.  In this particular case the landlord lost almost $80,000 worth of rent, legal fees, and lots of time and energy.. Depending on the location of the building, the landlord/owner and his/her ties with the judges who process evictions, evicting a tenant for non-payment can take up to TWO YEARS.  Now, take into consideration how expensive rents are, imagine how much landlords pay in taxes, water bills, suage,heat and other logistics and it should make a lot more sense to you what makes renting in NYC so crazy.  Now, on top of all this, add on a MUCH higher demand than supply, lots of options, tons of real estate agents and a tax write off for a vacant unit.  Pre-paid rent/ extra security is usuallysomething a landlord prefers not to deal with. Makes it more difficult for the landlord to evict someone for disturbances (they already paid) and a chance they could be a "holdover tenant" once the year is up.

What month can I find the best deal to rent in NYC? 

Many people assume that the best months to find a deal in NYC is December-February.  This is not necessarily true.  Although it really depends on particularly what your looking for (i.e. most two bedrooms are only available in the summer because it's common for college students to share), the best deals come up in the week before Thanksgiving, the week before Christmas and towards the end of March.  



Final Words

All in all NYC's real estate market is hotter than ever.  Considering that 40% of all condo purchases were all cash buyers, I think it's safe to assume that people still believe in the future of NYC.  With financing being very difficult to attain, many people who would consider buying are now renting. That, coupled with the large number of foreigners coming to NYC to live the dream, rents are now at RECORD highs.  A diligent, hard working honest agent is now more needed than ever.

In a snapshot: Condo's

-No board interview required. Condo has first right of refusal

-Usually 80% financing is allowed, but at times can be up to 90%

-Closings normally take place within 1-2 months of contract signing

-Renovations are allowed; all you have to do is notify the board

-Common charges and taxes are separate. Your monthly common charges depend on the sq ft of the unit.

-Subletting is allowed but the potential subletter may incur condo board fees

-Can sell any time seller chooses to.  Condo board has first right of refusal (first option to buy at listing price)


In a snapshot: Co-op's

- Board package submitted to board members of co-op with full financial disclosure and references required. After financials are in order, applicants must interview in person with the co-op board. Board can approve or reject applications without providing reason

-80% financing is usually the starting point, but larger down payments are not uncommon

-Closings normally take 3 - 4 months from contract signing

-Renovations are allowed with board approval. Any changes must follow regulations and procedures of the building

-Monthly charges include the Maintenance fee (covers heat, hot water, staff salaries, real estate taxes, building's underlying mortgage, etc) is based on shares owned in the co-op. Taxes are included in the Maintenance. 

-Subletting depends on building's sublet policy, almost always requires board approval. Often boards limit the length of time allowed. Pieda-tierre may be permitted, depending on the building's policy.

-Selling a co-op is more difficult than a condo. The building may impose a selling tax and potential buyers are subject to same approval process
