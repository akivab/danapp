After a long, hectic summer, it's finally coming to an end.  For those veteran NYC renters who have been waiting till after labor day to move..I'm sure your quite relieved.  It is finally now time where the out of towners have settled in, and renters finally have a bit more leeway in finding a place to live.  With vacancy rates holding at all time lows, I wouldn't expect too much to change from now through Halloween.  On another note, the sales market downtown has been crazier than ever.  One bedrooms from 500k-700k in the west village seem to be VERY popular right now..just last week an apartment on Barrow st that was only 300 sq ft and in a WALK-UP building sold for 549,000! 

Nightclub waitress and Ex- Tiger Woods Mistress sells apartment

The Real Deal just reported that Rachel Uchitel (Tiger Woods main go-to mistress and ex-marquee night club bottle waitress) sold her posh Park Ave condo for $1.95 million, turning a profit of $300,000. That's over a 15% profit margin (she did gut renovate it). You can see some pics of the apartment here http://streeteasy.com/nyc/sale/585577-condo-77-park-avenue-murray-hill-new-york


For those Kim Kardashian fans apparently she just moved into the Penthouse at Gansevoort on Park by 29th st while she looks to purchase a new pad and enjoy her engagement.

I had to add this one in for all people looking for a steal...nicely renovated Gramercy Park studio..this just got on the market and the agent is asking for an all cash deal..this was last sold in 2006 for $250,000..it's quite obvious this owner is strapped for cash and needs to load this apartment off ASAP...with a low maintenance of under $600/month this is definitely an awesome option for someone with cash looking for a deal!
