"Yoga controls body and mind to enable them to harmonize with spirit"

Does getting into a New York City cab first thing in the morning help you achieve harmony?  If not—and if, like so many of us, your morning yoga workout is indispensible to the tranquility you feel throughout the day--you simply must live within a short walk of your yoga studio.  A cab ride will not do.
 
Hot yoga styles are particularly well suited to the early morning yogi.  According to abc-of-yoga.com, the heated room increases muscle flexibility and reduces the risk of injury.  Two of the most popular hot yoga methods are the Bikram Yoga method, innovated by Bikram Choudhury, and the Moksha Yoga method, innovated by Ted Grant and Jessica Robertson.  Lucky for Village and Lower East Side residents, they're right next door—Moksha in the West Village, and Bikram in the East.  Not a morning person?  They're open all day!
 
To better serve my wellness-conscious clients, I recently met with several yoga studios in both the East Village and the West Village.  Let me emphasize that there are many fine yoga studios with a wide variety of styles to suit every possible yoga need.  I am sharing with you the studios that impressed me the most personally, but this is a decision that you should make after considering numerous options.  Yoga goes beyond stretching and meditating; it provides you with a network of like-minded people with whom to socialize and get involved in community and global issues.

Greenwich/West Village: Moksha Yoga
434 6th Avenue, Second Floor
 
Moksha Yoga is a newer style that originated in Canada in 2004 and now has a network of studios throughout the U.S. and Canada.  As you enter the West Village Moksha Yoga studio, you immediately sense the emphasis on environmental consciousness.  Flooring, insulation, and paint are all chosen with an affinity for nature and an avoidance of toxins.  You have the sense that the air you are breathing is very clean.
 
Moksha Yoga offers classes for everyone from the novice level to the most advanced practitioners.  But much of what Moksha Yoga is about happens outside the classes; the community comes together for numerous events, charities and outings.

East Village/Lower East Side: Bikram Yoga
172 Allen Street, Second Floor
 
One of the most popular yoga studios downtown is Bikram LES.  Bikram LES caters to virtually everyone; pregnant women, college students, young and old alike are welcome.  Under the leadership of Tricia Donegan, Bikram LES has brought aboard some of the best instructora in New York City.
 
Bikram is a hot yoga style for those seeking flexibility, detoxification or weight loss.  Bikram LES is a community center with great events, and a pass that allows for discounts at some of the best local establishments.

These are just two prime examples of the great facilities available next door to you, whether you choose to live in the West Village or in the East.  It goes without saying that, as with any form of exercise, you should check with your doctor before you begin any yoga class.  And I hope you'll check with me when you're moving to or within the Village.
