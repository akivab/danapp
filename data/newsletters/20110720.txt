This summer has been one for the record books. With a downtown vacancy rate of near .4% (For those who don't like math: 1 in about 250 apartments are available at any given time) prices have surged this summer. Depending on what neighborhood your looking to move to, between broker fees (15% of the annual rent) and rent increases (between 10 and 20%) you can expect anywhere from a 10-25% increase in rent costs.  WOW! Is buying the answer to all your problems? Read on...

My advice? Stay put unless absolutely necessary to move.  Since many renters found "great deals" the past two years it will take some time for landlords to increase rent high enough to push them out and put the market back in normal cycle.  When? Who knows. There are good deals out there, but timing is essential and having an agent who is on top of everything is critical. With so much information to go through it is pertinent in this market to have an agent who knows the right landlords, buildings and neighborhoods to fit your needs.  Otherwise you will find yourself in quite a frusturating situation. 


Time to Buy?

Even the sales market is in havoc. Bidding wars are an often occurence in SoHo, Nolita and the West Village. Looking for a deal? Check out Midtown (both east and west) where new developments are keeping the market in equilibrium.  With mortgage rates still quite low, it is DEFINITELY worth checking out what's out there and seeing if it would work for you.  Shoot me an email and we can further discuss some options. 

If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to contact me anytime at 516-578-4564. I am always available to advise you on purchasing, selling, renting or investing.
