Everyone knows that old adage about the only two certainties in life – death and taxes – but we can safely add one more to the list: If you want a stunning view in Manhattan, it's not gonna be cheap.
Whether you dream of waking to a breathtaking bird's eye view of Central Park, a stunning – yet calming – overlook on the Hudson, an intimate perspective of Gramercy Park, or a prestigious outlook on Washington Square Park, Manhattan views come at a cost. However, some views are pricier than others; factors like location and building amenities greatly influence apartment pricing.
Though Manhattan is filled with parks, Central, Gramercy and Washington Square offer the most desirable and prestigious views. And if you're looking below 14th Street -- where parks are in short supply -- you'll undoubtedly want a tranquil, relaxing view of the Hudson.
Let's take a look at Manhattan's three premium parks and explore how park and river views affect pricing.

Central Park

If you're like virtually everyone else in the known universe, you probably crave a rental with Central Park views. In fact, according to the Wall Street Journal, typical apartment sales on Central Park's border are priced at more than double that of similar properties in neighboring areas. Just to show how desirable those park views are, that's a 118% premium!

Gramercy Park


Located between E. 20th and E. 21st Street, between Gramercy Park West and East, Gramercy Park was a swamp until 1831, when it was developed by Sam Ruggles. Today, it's Manhattan's only private park; only residents who live in the surrounding buildings receive keys for park access, making Gramercy Park the ultimate in exclusive urban green-spaces. On average, apartments with a direct view of Gramercy Park command from 40 to 50% more than do similar, sans-view properties.

(Data compiled using several recent sales on both Gramercy Park South and North)

Washington Square

Speaking of exclusive and unique, Washington Square Park offers another of Manhattan's most desirable views. As most of the park's surrounding building are owned by New York University, direct views are extremely hard to come by. Not surprisingly, properties that surround the park command huge premiums – up to 75% for direct park views.

(Data compiled using several recent sales at 1 Fifth Ave. and 32 Washington Square West.)

The table below illustrates the differences in the average price per square foot (PPSQ) of properties with park views, river views or no views. These are averages over the last year in closed sales.

(This data was compiled using averages of closed sales over the past year. Since data is so difficult to gather, figures are estimates. There may be a significant difference in what you actually pay for a view depending on factors such as the building, timing and location.)

Note that:

1. The average PPSQ of a Central Park view is $2,312, while the no-view PPSQ averages $992. That's 2.33 times more -- a 133% premium -- for the same space. In contrast, river views have an average PPSQ of $1,644, or a 65% premium.

2. The average PPSQ of Gramercy Park is much less than that of Central Park -- for obvious reasons. Direct Gramercy Park views have an average PPSQ of $1,212; no-view PPSQ averages are $1,148 – that's a mere 6% premium. On the contrary, river views demand an average PPSQ of $1,463 -- a 22% premium. Keep in mind that East River views command significantly less than Hudson River views.

3. The average PPSQ in the West Village for park views is $1,320, or just a 9.1% premium. On the other hand, river views in this district have an average PPSQ of $1,759, or a 32% premium. 

It's not exactly breaking news that views command higher prices, but here in Manhattan, park views are especially desirable; after all, when you're constantly surrounded by towering skyscrapers, that glance at nature every morning can really provide peace of mind.
In this tricky market, it's essential to have the right real estate agent evaluate the value of your view. As we've seen, certain views make enormous price differences, another important factor to keep in mind when shopping for an apartment. Let your real estate agent know what matters to you most -- and be prepared to pay a premium for any type of view, whether it's park or river.
