The West Village:
Ah--the West Village.  Everyone wants to live here but few have that privilege.  Stacked with charming tree-lined blocks, cobblestone streets, beautiful people, celebrities, restaurants, lounges and nightclubs, it is no secret what makes the West Village the most sought-after neighborhood in New York City.  As you might imagine, finding your perfect West Village home may be one of the most difficult things in life...apart from finding a unicorn or maybe your soul-mate.

The West Village has one of the lowest vacancy rates in all Manhattan, hovering consistently around 0.33% (not a math major? about one in 300 apartments are vacant at any given moment).  Whoa.  With strict building codes limiting new development and overall inventory, don't count on many new apartments being built in the near future.

Check out the narrowest house in all New York City at only 9.5 feet wide!  It's on the popular Bedford Street block, and it rents for $14,000/month.

Best West Village Rooftop Pools 

Everyone has a vision of a beautiful summer day by the pool.  Rooftop pools in the West Village are few and far between--but there is some stiff competition for the best rooftop pool!

300 Mercer St. (Overlooking Washington Sq Park)

300 Mercer Street is one of the very few rental buildings with a rooftop swimming pool.  At 36 flights up, this rooftop pool has breathtaking city views, beach chairs and a beautiful crowd to match.  300 Mercer is a pet-friendly building that caters to young professionals and families interested in the desirable PS-41 school district.  One bedrooms start at about $3,500/month, two bedrooms at about $5,000/month.  Some apartments have terraces.

2 Cooper Square (Greenwich Village)

2 Cooper Square is another rental building with top-of-the-line amenities and a to-die-for rooftop pool.  Although a bit small, the rooftop at 2 Cooper features several bars, barbecue areas and beach chairs.  For someone who likes to host those summer get-togethers this is definitely one that will wow all your friends.  The pool is 16 flights up, yet still boasts some spectacular city views.  Studios start at $4,000/month, one bedrooms at $5,000/month, and two bedrooms at $7,000/month.  2 Cooper has some of the best amenities any building in the city has to offer.

385 W 12 (Across from the Hudson River, just West of Washington St.)

385 W 12 is a new condo development literally across from the Hudson River.  Personally my favorite of all three buildings I've discussed here, this decadent rooftop features not only a pool, but a hot tub for those cold wintery nights.  Looking right out onto the sparkling Hudson, only eight flights up (the building has a mere twelve apartments), there is nothing blocking the views from this rooftop.  With the addition of the hot tub this rooftop can be used year-round and therefore is the most versatile and a favorite of renters and buyers.  Although apartments for rent are rare, there have been a few four bedrooms listed at $27,000/month.  Now this is living!

The most expensive West Village blocks

As in every neighborhood, the West Village has "macro" and "micro" rent averages.  Very subtle differences can drastically alter prices on a given block.
 
You need to start with some idea of your budget.  I like to divide renter/purchasers into three broad categories:
 
·         The "middle class" renter/purchaser is typically looking for a roommate share rental or first home purchase.  Each roommate typically will spend $1,500-$2,000/month on a rental, and a purchaser is looking at something which will require a down payment no larger than $250,000--typically a $500,000 to $1.5 million home.
·         The "upper class" renter/purchaser--say, the newly-promoted lawyer or banker 5-8 years into the job--can spend between $3,000/month and $8,000/month renting (income between $200,000 and $500,000/year) and is ready to make a down payment of between $250,000 and $1,000,000.  This will buy an apartment priced at around $1.5 to $5 million.
·         The "super rich" renter/purchaser--heirs, senior partners, chief executives and "A list" celebrities--can spend $10,000/month to $100,000/month (net income over $1,000,000/year, net worth over $10 million) and is ready to pay cash for an apartment ranging from $5 million and up.
 
When it comes to the West Village, the blocks that interest the "super rich" are not the ones most people would consider ideal in terms of location.  For most of us, an ideal location means easy subway access, central location, bars and restaurants at your feet.  The "super rich" don't look for these things.  They prefer slightly more secluded areas, and since the "super rich" don't take subways (you can find them in some type of maybach or suburban), central location isn't necessary.  In the West Village there has recently been a spike in demand for apartments close to Washington Street (one block east of the Hudson River) anywhere from Clarkson Street to West 13th Street.  When you're looking for an apartment keep in mind that the demand rises the farther west you go in the West Village, and ironically, demand falls the farther east you go in the East Village.  (The west side commands much higher prices than the east side.)



Final Words

The West Village is quite an amazing place to live.  It has a lot to offer for everyone from the incoming student to the prominent businessman, actors, professionals and almost everyone in between.  On its winding streets you can find both the 1880's landmark townhouse and the new development with its rooftop pool.  A good real estate agent will help you navigate this tricky market.
